Project Description: 3rd floor tenant apartment gets extremely hot especially now with this heat wave. They have installed window units, blackout curtains, a tower unit, dehumidifiers and still nothing is working and theyve said utilities bill is through the roof. The sun strikes directly into their living room. They’ve asked if I could potentially install a mini-split but I’m wondering if insulation needs to be checked and duct too there’s also an animal smell lingering. Is there anything else I can do to try and help fix this?! Her thermostat showed 91 degrees just from yesterday in the living room.

We discovered a problem as of yesterday upon an independent inspection we had initiated that the exhausts from 4 of our bedrooms have never been connected to vents outside. I want to understand how much this can cost to create pathways from bathroom exhausts to vents and how big of a job it is time-wise and intervention-wise.

Comments: I have a triplex and I need to apply for the rental license. I don’t have a CFO but I have paperwork from 1964 showing proof it’s a triplex and it’s been used that way ever since. When I bought it the owner didn’t have recent rental licenses. I would like to Apple for use of registration permit and then apply for rental licenses without triggering a need for a sprinkler system. I want to make sure the forms are filled out correctly and get the rental licenses.

Comments: I&#039;m based in California and this is a recently renovated property I&#039;m still getting to know. Would like an HVAC professional to look at the entire house and make recommendations, not only consider the tenant&#039;s comments. I considered wall-mounted heaters for the two rooms, but that will raise the electric bill. So I&#039;m exploring all my options.

Still waiting for the money from that. In the meantime, the tenant has said zero correspondence. Non-responsive. I think it’s time to begin eviction proceedings and I need some support around that.

Project Description: NEED INSULATION CONTRACTOR: We had a specialist come out to assess some minor mold in our attic, and he noted that one of the underlying issues may be *inadequate insulation*. He pointed out a few areas where insulation is missing entirely and where it is too thin / not up to code and suggested that improving or replacing the existing insulation would help prevent future moisture problems.
