## How Matching Works (Behind the Scenes)

Understanding what happens when you match vendors helps you do a better job.

### What You See in the Matching Window

When you click "Match," the system shows you vendors that:
- Offer the service the landlord needs (plumber, electrician, etc.)
- Work in the area where the property is located
- Are marked as "Active" in the system

For each vendor, you'll see:
- **Business name** and contact person
- **Services** they offer
- **Service areas** (zip codes where they work)
- **Rating** (stars based on landlord reviews)
- **Badges** showing if they're Licensed, Insured, or have Rental Experience

### Choosing the Right Vendors

**Good matching tips:**

1. **Match the service exactly** - If they need a plumber, pick plumbers (not handymen)

2. **Check the location** - Make sure the vendor serves that zip code

3. **Consider urgency** - For emergencies, pick vendors known for fast response

4. **Look at ratings** - Higher-rated vendors (more stars) have better track records

5. **Pick 2-3 vendors** - Give the landlord options, but not too many choices

### What Happens When You Click "Send Introductions"

The system does several things automatically:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  YOU CLICK "SEND INTRODUCTIONS"                         │

│     "Your [Service] Vendors Are Ready!"                 │
│     - Lists all matched vendors with contact info       │
│     - Shows vendor badges (Licensed, Insured, etc.)     │
│     - Includes next steps                               │
│                                                         │
│     📧 EMAIL TO EACH VENDOR:                            │
│     "New Job Referral: [Service] in [Location]"         │
│     - Job details (service, location, urgency)          │
│     - Job description from landlord                     │
│     - Landlord's contact information                    │
│     - Asks them to respond within 24 hours              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### What the Landlord Receives

The landlord gets an email with:
- A friendly introduction
- **Vendor cards** for each matched vendor showing:
  - Business name
  - Contact person's name
  - Phone number
  - Email address
  - Website (if they have one)
  - Badges: Licensed ✓, Insured ✓, Rental Experience ✓
- Their original job description (so they remember what they asked for)
- **Next steps:** Contact vendors, get quotes, schedule work, leave a review

### What Each Vendor Receives

Each vendor gets their own email with:
- Notice that this is a referral from Real Landlording
- **Complete job details:**
  - Type of service needed
  - Property location
  - How urgent it is
  - Budget range (if the landlord provided one)
  - Full job description
- **Landlord's contact information:**
  - Name
  - Email
  - Phone number
- A request to **respond within 24 hours**

### After You Match

Once you send introductions:

1. **Your job is done** (for now) - The landlord and vendors will contact each other directly

2. **The request shows "Matched"** - You can see this in the status column

3. **Check back later** - In a few days, you might follow up to see if the connection worked

### Important Notes

| Remember | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| You can only match **up to 3 vendors** per request | Too many options confuse landlords |
| You **cannot undo** a match once sent | Double-check before clicking send |
| Emails go out **immediately** | Make sure you selected the right vendors |
| Only **Active** vendors appear | If a vendor is missing, check their status |
